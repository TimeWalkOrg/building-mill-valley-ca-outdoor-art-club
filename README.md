# The Outdoor Art Club
1 West Blithedale Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History
The Outdoor Art Club was formed when a group of women in Mill Valley, dedicated to the preservation of the area’s natural beauty, became concerned that the large numbers of visitors and picnickers to the area were destroying plant life. Famed architect Bernard Maybeck was chosen by the club to design the building. The building is surrounded by beautiful foliage.

Some interesting facts about the Outdoor Art Club (OAC): In addition to its beautification and civic projects, the OAC provided food, shelter and aid during the 1906 earthquake and the large Mill Valley fires in 1910 and 1929. During World War I and World War II the clubhouse was offered to the Red Cross for service. During the march for Women’s Suffrage, the club worked to raise money for the movement. Today, the Outdoor Art Club is still an active women’s civic club and social center. It is rented out for weddings, parties and other social functions.
